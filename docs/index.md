# About
Welcome to the phylojs documentation! The phylojs repo can be found at [https://github.com/clockor2/phylojs](https://github.com/clockor2/phylojs). 

Phylojs is a javascript and typescript library for reading, writing, and manipulating phylogenetic trees. It is intended as a utility library to manipulate trees from input and before visualisation.

Phylojs is a small library with zerio-dependencies. It has 3 functions for reading and writing trees. It also includes two classes: nodes and trees, with the tree object a nesting of nodes. All the rest of the functionality included as methods on both classes, which these docs describe. There are also some [examples](./examples/) of using phylojs.
