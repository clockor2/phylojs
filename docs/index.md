# About
Welcome to the PhyloJS documentation! The PhyloJS repo can be found at [https://github.com/clockor2/phylojs](https://github.com/clockor2/phylojs). 

Phylojs is a JavaScript and TypeScript library for reading, writing, and manipulating phylogenetic trees. It is intended as a utility library to manipulate trees from input and before visualisation.

Phylojs is a small library with no dependencies. It has functions for reading trees from Newick/Extended Newick, Nexus, PhyloXML, NeXML, PhyJSON, and writing to Newick and Nexus. It includes two classes: nodes and trees, with the tree object wrapping a nesting of nodes. All the rest of the functionality is included as methods on either class, which the API describes. There are also some interactive [examples](./examples/) of using PhyloJS.
